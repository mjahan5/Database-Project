# Database-Project
#Movie Generator 

 
I create a movie recommender that generated random suggestions on a topic. I decided on this topic because I wanted to help movie watchers decide on what movie they should watch. Watching movies is a very popular activity for the majority. When it comes to choosing what to watch, most people end up getting stuck and can't make a decision. With the spread of Netflix and other streaming websites, movies have become readily available with a wide range of choices. It can sometimes take an average person seven to ten minutes just deciding on what to watch. I wanted to create an app that can help solve this common problem. I decided to make this project an easy-to-use mobile application so that anyone can be able to use it at any given time. The app does not require any user login or signup. It is simple and easy to use, all the user needs to do is just download the app, open it up, and click the button, which will then generate a random movie for them to watch. (This project was created in my Database systems class, there are a few adjustments that need to be made to the application which I am continuing to work on. )
